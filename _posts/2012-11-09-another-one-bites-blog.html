So after many many years of not doing what the rest of the world is doing (eating hamburgers ? ), I finally decided to join the community and start my own technical blog.<br /><br />In this blog I hope to focus on some of the interesting stuff I enjoy in my profession: low level programming, kernel, storage, virtualization and functional programming.<br /><br />The name of the blog: meta-x86 is a merge of two things: the shortcut in my favorite editor (<a href="http://xkcd.com/378/">meta+x</a>) and the architecture I enjoy hacking.<br /><br />Get ready for quality posts :)<br /><br />
