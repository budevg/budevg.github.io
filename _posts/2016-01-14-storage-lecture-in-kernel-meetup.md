There was another really nice meetup at the local
[Tel-Aviv kernel meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Tel-Aviv-Yafo-Linux-Kernel-Meetup/events/227539106/).
This meetup group which is organized by [Kfir Gollan](http://www.meetup.com/Tel-Aviv-Yafo-Linux-Kernel-Meetup/members/82534572/)
has really great community of people all around Israel's hitech arena.

In the first lecture [Mark Veltzer](https://github.com/veltzer) was talking about locks in userspace and kernel.
Awesome topic which is so much important for daily programming in the land of c.

After that I did a presentation about
[high performance storage devices](/slides/high-performance-storage-devices-in-kernel.pdf).
At the end there was a nice discussion about the fact that storage has many things
in common with networking and that many problems which were already solved in the networking
world are being solved today in storage.
